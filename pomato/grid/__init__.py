"""The Grid Model of POMATO

These two modules provide the grid functionality to POMATO. And is initialied as an attribute to the
POMATO instance when data is (successfully) loaded.

The functionality of the GridTopology include:

    - Calculation of the ptdf matrix (power transfer distribution factor), used in linear power flow
      analysis.
    - Calculation of the lodf matrix (load outage distribution factor), to account for
      contingencies.
    - Validation of the input topology based on the nodes and lines data. This includes verification
      of the chosen slacks/reference nodes and setting of multiple slacks if needed. Also providing
      the information about which nodes should be balanced through which slack.
    - Validation of possible contingencies. This means that lines that disconnect nodes or groups of
      nodes cannot be considered as a contingency.
    - A selection of methods that allow for contingency analysis by obtaining N-1 ptdf matrices by
      lines, outages or with a sensitivity filter.


The purpose of the GridModel is to create a usable grid representation for the market model. This
module acts as a combinator of the data and grid modules and allow to easily change grid
representation for the market model.

There are currently the following options:
    * dispatch : Not grid representation at all, meaning that the whole market is cleared with
      uniform pricing i.e. as a copper plate.
    * ntc : Constraining zonal exchange with net transfer capacities. These are should be part of
      the input data.
    * nodal : Nodal pricing through linear power flow inform of the ptdf matrix. This is also
      denoted as optimal power flow (OPF), where each nodal injection is constrained by all lines in
      the network.
    * zonal : Representation through a zonal ptdf. This implementation uses the nodal ptdf matrix
      and an assumptions of how the zonal net position is distributed across all nodes. This
      assumptions is often denoted as node-to-zone mapping, participation actor or generation shift
      key (gsk).

      There are currently two options available:
          - gmax : It is assumed that nodes participate in the net position proportional to the
            conventional capacity installed.
          - flat : all nodes participate equally.


Additionally, this model can provide two N-1 grid representations which allow to preemptively
represent the N-1 criterion, this is the main feature and the main reason why its organized in a
module.

The two options are:
    - scopf :  A nodal representation including contingencies. This is often denoted as
      security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF). This setting comes with multiple methods that
      enable pomato to find the smallest set of constraints to guaranty SCOPF. These are scribed in
      the methods of :class:`~pomato.grid.GridTopology` and in the corresponding paper in the *See
      Also* section below.
    - fbmc : Creating a non-redundant zonal version of the security constrained nodal
      representation, similar to the scopf options.

The grid representation with contingencies come with additional methods that filter and reduce the
number of constraints.

There are multiple options available:
    - full : no constraints are removed. This leads to a very large ptdf matrix and is generally not
      recommended. For example the IEEE 118 bus case study includes 186 branches, therefore the N-1
      ptdf matrix would consists of a 34.596 x 118 ptdf matrix. So even a very small network will
      cause significant number of constraints.
    - redundancy_removal/conditional_redundancy_removal : Will reduce the number constraints
      significantly. Takes a fairly long time for large networks (a few hours for the 995 line DE
      case study, with gurobi).

The options which grid representation is generated is ["optimization"]["type"] and option for the
reduction level is under ["grid"]["redundancy_removal_option"].
